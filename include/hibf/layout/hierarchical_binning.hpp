     *
     * Explanations to the formula:
     *
     * Remember that M (matrix) stores the maximum technical bin size of the high level IBF (HIBF) and
     * L (ll_matrix) stores the sum of all estimate low level ibfs (LIBF) memory footprints
     * (assuming perfect splitting of kmer_content which can obviously not be achieved but `alpha` may be adjusted
     * in order to counteract this underestimation).
     *
     * Now in order to minimize the memory footprint we...
     *
     * 1. ... (\f$v_ij\f$) firstly check if we should split the bin. <br>
     * Therefore we compute for every possible \f$ i' \f$ above \f$ i \f$, the technical bin size if we split
     * \f$ c_j \f$ into \f$ i - i' \f$ bins (\f$ \frac{c_j}{i - i'} \f$). We only take the maximum of the current
     * maximum where I come from (\f$ M_{i',j-1} \f$) and the new technical bin size computed just now.
     * This maximum is the new current *maximum technical bin size* that needs to be multiplied by the current number
     * technical bins \f$ (i + 1) \f$ in order to estimate the memory footprint of the HIBF.
     * Now that we have the memory footprint of the HIBF we also consider the LIBFs memory footprint but nothing
     * changed here, since we split not merge, so we just take \f$ L_{i',j-1} \f$ scaled by alpha.
     *
     * 2. ... (\f$h_ij\f$) secondly check if we should merge the bin with the ones before.<br>
     * Therefore we start by compute for every possible \f$ j' \f$ to the left of \f$ j \f$, the merged bin weight
     * (\f$ \sum_{g = j'}^{j} c_g \f$) of merging together user bins \f$ [j', ...,  j] \f$. This is only possible
     * iff every bin \f$ [j', ...,  j] \f$ was **not splitted**. If we merge those bins starting with user bin
     * \f$ j' \f$ we start the trace at \f$ M_{i-1,j'-1} \f$. Therefore we need to compute the new maximal technical
     * bin size of the HIBF, which is the maximum of the merged bin weight and where we would come from
     * (\f$ \max(M_{i-1,j'-1}, \sum_{g = j'}^{j} c_g) \f$) and multiple it by the number of technical bins so far
     * \f$ (i + 1) \f$ to get the HIBF memory footprint. The LIBFs memory footprint also changes since we introduce a
     * new merged bin. Namely, we add the weight of the new merged bin (\f$ \sum_{g = j'}^{j} c_g \f$) again to the
     * LIBFs memory footprint from where we would come from \f$ L_{i-1,j'-1} \f$ and scale this by alpha. Just adding
     * the combined merged bin weight neglects the fact, that the merged bin weight has to be distributed within the
     * new low level IBF, potentially causing the effective text ratio and thereby the IBF memory footprint to increase.
     * This we cannot know before hand how the data are, we need to accept this as a flaw in the "optimumal result" of
     * this algorithm. It would be too computational intensive to compute the splitting for every possibility.
