/*!\brief The configuration used to build an (H)IBF
 *
 * # The (H)IBF config
 *
 * The configuration can be used to construct an HIBF or IBF.
 *
 * When constructing an IBF, only the members `General Configuration` are considered, layout parameters from
 * the section `HIBF Layout Configuration` are ignored.
 *
 * Here is the list of all configs options:
 *
 * | Type    |  Option Name                                     | Default | Note                   |

 * | General | seqan::hibf::config::number_of_user_bins         | -       | [REQUIRED]             |
 * | General | seqan::hibf::config::number_of_hash_functions    | 2       |                        |
 * | General | seqan::hibf::config::maximum_false_positive_rate | 0.05    | [RECOMMENDED_TO_ADAPT] |
 * | General | seqan::hibf::config::threads                     | 1       | [RECOMMENDED_TO_ADAPT] |
 * | Layout  | seqan::hibf::config::sketch_bits                 | 12      |                        |
 * | Layout  | seqan::hibf::config::tmax                        | 0       | 0 indicates unset      |
 * | Layout  | seqan::hibf::config::max_rearrangement_ratio     | 0.5     |                        |
 * | Layout  | seqan::hibf::config::alpha                       | 1.2     |                        |

 *
 * As a copy and paste source, here are all config options with their defaults:
 *
 * \include test/snippet/hibf/hibf_construction.cpp
 *
 * ## The HIBF takes too long to construct?
 *
 * Check the documentation of the following options that influence the runtime:
 * * seqan::hibf::config::threads
 * * seqan::hibf::config::max_rearrangement_ratio
 * * seqan::hibf::config::disable_estimate_union
 * * seqan::hibf::config::disable_rearrangement
 *
 * ## The HIBF memory consumption is too high?
 *
 * Check the documentation of the following options that influence the memory consumption:
 * * seqan::hibf::config::threads
 * * seqan::hibf::config::number_of_hash_functions

     *
     * To efficiently construct the hierarchical structure of the HIBF, the input needs to be given as a
     * [function object](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/functional). The IBF construction can be done
     * in another way (see seqan::hibf::interleaved_bloom_filter) but has the config construction for consistency.
     *
     * \include test/snippet/hibf/config_input_fn_dummy.cpp
     *
     * It is important that the function object, a lambda in the example, has exactly two parameters:
     * (1) A `size_t const` which reflects the user bin ID to add hashes/values to in the (H)IBF.
     * (2) A `seqan::hibf::insert_iterator` that inserts hashes via `it = hash` where `hash` must be convertible to
     *     `uint64_t`.
     *
     * The above example would just insert a single hash (`42`) into each user bin.
     *
     * Let's look at two more realistic examples.
     *
     * **Inserting from a vector of values**:
     *
     * \include test/snippet/hibf/config_input_fn_vector.cpp

     *
     * \snippet test/snippet/hibf/config_input_fn_file.cpp main
     *
     * \attention Since the number of user bins cannot be inferred from the function object, you need to pass them by a
     * separate config member: `seqan::hibf::config::number_of_user_bins`.
